#NOTES  

##copy & pastes  

***

* Chapter `7` and `8` introduce the fancybox jQuery plugin.  
They each contain a folder labeled `fancybox`.  
Copy and paste the folder into the `_js` folder.  

* Chapter `7` has a folder labeled `example`.   
Copy and paste the folder into the `_js` folder.  
The `_js` folder should now contain 3three folders.  

* Chapter 8 has a folder labeled `images` with a single image file: `arrow.png`.  
Copy and paste the image file into the `_image` folder.


## misc  

---

* Chapter 9 introduces forms and validation.  
This tool might come inhandy: [html2jade](http://html2jade.aaron-powell.com/)  
Also, in the `validation.jade` file pay attention to the `form(action='...)`.  
A few extra steps are needed to get this working: `app.post()`.
