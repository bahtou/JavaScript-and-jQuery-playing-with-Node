#A good exercise to learn about [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [express.js](http://expressjs.com/)/[jade.js](http://jade-lang.com/).##

The book [JavsScript & jQuery: The Missing Manual](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920015048.do) comes with plenty of examples that can be downloaded.  

It wasn't until `chapter 11` that **AJAX** is introduced when the user must have a server up.  
I decided to flip through the books examples and import them into an `express` framework using `jade` to render the `html`.  

Once you get over the indentation that `jade` uses (if you're coming from `python` this is not an issue) it turns out you can do some pretty cool things.

## Getting Started ##

----------
- Run the command `express JSandjQ` to setup the project folders.
- `cd JSandjQ` and run `npm install`.  
- Go to [JavsScript & jQuery: The Missing Manual](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920015048.do) and download the example code.  
- `copy/paste` the `_css`, `_images`, `_js` files from the example code into the `public` folder created during the express setup.  
- All set to follow the examples and pump out some **NODE!**
